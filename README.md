## Part 1: Describe core Azure concepts
### What is cloud computing?
It's the delivery of computing services over the internet, which is otherwise known as the cloud. These services include servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence. Cloud computing offers faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

### Why is cloud computing typically cheaper to use?
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet by using a pay-as-you-go pricing model. You typically pay only for the cloud services you use, which helps you:

- Lower your operating costs.
- Run your infrastructure more efficiently.
- Scale as your business needs change.

To put it another way, cloud computing may be a way to lease compute power and capacity from somebody else's datacenter. You'll treat cloud assets like you'd assets in your own datacenter. When you're done utilizing them, you donate them back. You're charged as it were for what you use. Instead of keeping up CPUs and capacity in your datacenter, you lease them for the time that you simply require them.

The cloud supplier takes care of keeping up the fundamental framework for you. The cloud empowers you to rapidly unravel your hardest commerce challenges, and bring cutting-edge arrangements to your clients.#

### Why should I move to the cloud?
The cloud helps you move faster and innovate in ways that were once nearly impossible.

In our ever-changing digital world, two trends emerge:

- Teams deliver new features to their users at record speeds.
- Users expect an increasingly rich and immersive experience with their devices and with software.

To power your services and deliver innovative and novel user experiences more quickly, the cloud provides on-demand access to:

- A nearly limitless pool of raw compute, storage, and networking components
- Speech recognition and other cognitive services that help make your application stand out from the crowd.
- Analytics services that deliver telemetry data from your software and devices.

### What is Azure?
Azure is a continually expanding set of cloud services that help your organization meet your current and future business challenges. Azure gives you the freedom to build, manage, and deploy applications on a massive global network using your favorite tools and frameworks.

### What can I do with Azure?
Azure provides more than 100 services that enable you to do everything from running your existing applications on virtual machines, to exploring new software paradigms, such as intelligent bots and mixed reality.  Many teams start exploring the cloud by moving their existing applications to virtual machines that run in Azure. 

### How does Azure work?
Azure is a public and private platform that helps users to build, deploy and manage their applications. A technology known as virtualization which seprates the coupling between a computer's hardware and operating system using a abstraction layer called a hypervisor. The hypervisor emulates all the functions of a computer in a virtual machine. It can run multiple virtual machines at the same time and they can run any compatiable OS such as Windows and Linux. Each server contains and hypervisor.
