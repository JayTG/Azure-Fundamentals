## Part 1: Describe core Azure concepts
### What is cloud computing?
It's the delivery of computing services over the internet, which is otherwise known as the cloud. These services include servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence. Cloud computing offers faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

![38-3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87706066/162168457-4450c033-8ae5-4774-b87a-a09e2af114c8.png)

### Why is cloud computing typically cheaper to use?
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet by using a pay-as-you-go pricing model. You typically pay only for the cloud services you use, which helps you:

- Lower your operating costs.
- Run your infrastructure more efficiently.
- Scale as your business needs change.

To put it another way, cloud computing may be a way to lease compute power and capacity from somebody else's datacenter. You'll treat cloud assets like you'd assets in your own datacenter. When you're done utilizing them, you donate them back. You're charged as it were for what you use. Instead of keeping up CPUs and capacity in your datacenter, you lease them for the time that you simply require them.

The cloud supplier takes care of keeping up the fundamental framework for you. The cloud empowers you to rapidly unravel your hardest commerce challenges, and bring cutting-edge arrangements to your clients.#

### Why should I move to the cloud?
The cloud helps you move faster and innovate in ways that were once nearly impossible.

In our ever-changing digital world, two trends emerge:

- Teams deliver new features to their users at record speeds.
- Users expect an increasingly rich and immersive experience with their devices and with software.

To power your services and deliver innovative and novel user experiences more quickly, the cloud provides on-demand access to:

- A nearly limitless pool of raw compute, storage, and networking components
- Speech recognition and other cognitive services that help make your application stand out from the crowd.
- Analytics services that deliver telemetry data from your software and devices.

### What is Azure?
Azure is a continually expanding set of cloud services that help your organization meet your current and future business challenges. Azure gives you the freedom to build, manage, and deploy applications on a massive global network using your favorite tools and frameworks.

### What can I do with Azure?
Azure provides more than 100 services that enable you to do everything from running your existing applications on virtual machines, to exploring new software paradigms, such as intelligent bots and mixed reality.  Many teams start exploring the cloud by moving their existing applications to virtual machines that run in Azure. 

### How does Azure work?
Azure is a public and private platform that helps users to build, deploy and manage their applications. A technology known as virtualization which seprates the coupling between a computer's hardware and operating system using a abstraction layer called a hypervisor. The hypervisor emulates all the functions of a computer in a virtual machine. It can run multiple virtual machines at the same time and they can run any compatiable OS such as Windows and Linux. Each server contains and hypervisor. A network switch provides connectivity to all those servers

### What is the Azure portal?

The Azure portal is a web-based, unified console that provides an alternative to command-line tools. With the Azure portal, you can manage your Azure subscription by using a graphical user interface. You can:

- Build, manage, and monitor everything from simple web apps to complex cloud deployments.
- Create custom dashboards for an organized view of resources.
- Configure accessibility options for an optimal experience.

The Azure portal is designed for resiliency and continuous availability. It maintains a presence in every Azure datacenter. This configuration makes the Azure portal resilient to individual datacenter failures and avoids network slowdowns by being close to users. The Azure portal updates continuously and requires no downtime for maintenance activities.

### What is Azure Marketplace?
Azure Marketplace helps connect users with Microsoft partners, independent software vendors, and startups that are offering their solutions and services, which are optimized to run on Azure. Azure Marketplace customers can find, try, purchase, and provision applications and services from hundreds of leading service providers. All solutions and services are certified to run on Azure.

### Azure services
Here's a big-picture view of the available services and features in Azure.

There are many different categories

- Compute
> Compute services are often one of the primary reasons why companies move to the Azure platform. Azure provides a range of options for hosting applications and services. Here are some examples of compute services in Azure.
- Networking
> Linking compute resources and providing access to applications is the key function of Azure networking. Networking functionality in Azure includes a range of options to connect the outside world to services and features in the global Azure datacenters.
- Storage
> Azure provides four main types of storage services. Azure Blob storage, Azure File storage, Azure Queue storage and Azure Table storage
- Mobile
> With Azure, developers can create mobile back-end services for iOS, Android, and Windows apps quickly and easily. Features that used to take time and increase project risks, such as adding corporate sign-in and then connecting to on-premises resources such as SAP, Oracle, SQL Server, and SharePoint, are now simple to include.
- Databases
> Azure provides multiple database services to store a wide variety of data types and volumes. And with global connectivity, this data is available to users instantly.
- Web
> Having a great web experience is critical in today's business world. Azure includes first-class support to build and host web apps and HTTP-based web services. The following Azure services are focused on web hosting.
- IoT
> People are able to access more information than ever before. Personal digital assistants led to smartphones, and now there are smart watches, smart thermostats, and even smart refrigerators. Personal computers used to be the norm. Now the internet allows any item that's online-capable to access valuable information. This ability for devices to garner and then relay information for data analysis is referred to as IoT.
- Big data
> Data comes in all formats and sizes. When we talk about big data, we're referring to large volumes of data. Data from weather systems, communications systems, genomic research, imaging platforms, and many other scenarios generate hundreds of gigabytes of data. This amount of data makes it hard to analyze and make decisions. It's often so large that traditional forms of processing and analysis are no longer appropriate.
- AI
> AI, in the context of cloud computing, is based around a broad range of services, the core of which is machine learning. Machine learning is a data science technique that allows computers to use existing data to forecast future behaviors, outcomes, and trends. Using machine learning, computers learn without being explicitly programmed.
- DevOps
> DevOps brings together people, processes, and technology by automating software delivery to provide continuous value to your users. With Azure DevOps, you can create build and release pipelines that provide continuous integration, delivery, and deployment for your applications. You can integrate repositories and application tests, perform application monitoring, and work with build artifacts. You can also work with and backlog items for tracking, automate infrastructure deployment, and integrate a range of third-party tools and services such as Jenkins and Chef. All of these functions and many more are closely integrated with Azure to allow for consistent, repeatable deployments for your applications to provide streamlined build and release processes.

### Cloud model comparison

#### Public cloud
- No capital expenditures to scale up.
- Applications can be quickly provisioned and deprovisioned.
- Organizations pay only for what they use.

#### Private cloud
- Hardware must be purchased for start-up and maintenance.
- Organizations have complete control over resources and security.
- Organizations are responsible for hardware maintenance and updates.

#### Hybrid cloud
- Provides the most flexibility.
- Organizations determine where to run their applications.
- Organizations control security, compliance, or legal requirements.

### What are some cloud computing advantages?
- **High availability:** Depending on the service-level agreement (SLA) that you choose, your cloud-based apps can provide a continuous user experience with no apparent downtime, even when things go wrong.
- **Scalability:** Apps in the cloud can scale vertically and horizontally:  
> - Scale vertically to increase compute capacity by adding RAM or CPUs to a virtual machine. 
> - Scaling horizontally increases compute capacity by adding instances of resources, such as adding VMs to the configuration.
- **Elasticity:** You can configure cloud-based apps to take advantage of autoscaling, so your apps always have the resources they need.
- **Agility:** Deploy and configure cloud-based resources quickly as your app requirements change.

- **Geo-distribution:** You can deploy apps and data to regional datacenters around the globe, thereby ensuring that your customers always have the best performance in their region.
- **Disaster recovery:** By taking advantage of cloud-based backup services, data replication, and geo-distribution, you can deploy your apps with the confidence that comes from knowing that your data is safe in the event of disaster.

### Capital expenses vs. operating expenses
There are two different types of expenses that you should consider:

- **Capital Expenditure (CapEx)** is the up-front spending of money on physical infrastructure, and then deducting that up-front expense over time. The up-front cost from CapEx has a value that reduces over time.
- **Operational Expenditure (OpEx)** is spending money on services or products now, and being billed for them now. You can deduct this expense in the same year you spend it. There is no up-front cost, as you pay for a service or product as you use it.

### Cloud computing is a consumption-based model
Cloud service providers operate on a consumption-based model, which means that end users only pay for the resources that they use. Whatever they use is what they pay for.

A consumption-based model has many benefits, including:

- No upfront costs.
- No need to purchase and manage costly infrastructure that users might not use to its fullest.
- The ability to pay for additional resources when they are needed.
- The ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed.

### What are cloud service models?
If you've been around cloud computing for a while, you've probably seen the PaaS, IaaS, and SaaS acronyms for the different cloud service models. These models define the different levels of shared responsibility that a cloud provider and cloud tenant are responsible for.

The following illustration demonstrates the services that might run in each of the cloud service models.

#### IaaS
IaaS is the most flexible category of cloud services. It aims to give you complete control over the hardware that runs your application. Instead of buying hardware, with IaaS, you rent it.
> Advantages: No CapEx, Agility, Consumption-based model, low skill requirement, Cloud benefits, Flexibility

#### PaaS
PaaS provides the same benefits and considerations as IaaS, but there are some additional benefits to be aware of.
> Advantages: No CapEx, Agility, Consumption-based model, low skill requirement, Cloud benefits, Productivity
>
> Disadvantage:  Platform limitations

#### SaaS
SaaS is software that's centrally hosted and managed for you and your users or customers. Usually one version of the application is used for all customers, and it's licensed through a monthly or annual subscription.

SaaS provides the same benefits as IaaS, but again there are some additional benefits to be aware of too.
> Advantages: No CapEx, Agility, Consumption-based model, low skill requirement, Cloud benefits, Flexibility
> 
> Disadvantage:  Software limitations

The following chart illustrates the various levels of responsibility between a cloud provider and a cloud tenant

### What is serverless computing?

Like PaaS, serverless computing enables developers to build applications faster by eliminating the need for them to manage infrastructure. With serverless applications, the cloud service provider automatically provisions, scales, and manages the infrastructure required to run the code. Serverless architectures are highly scalable and event-driven, only using resources when a specific function or trigger occurs.
